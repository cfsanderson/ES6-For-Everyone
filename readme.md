## My notes below...

### Temporal dead zone = you cannot access a variable before it has been defined

### when to use `var`/`let`/`const`
  - use `const` by default
  - only use `let` if rebinding is needed
  - (`var` shouldn't be used)

### Arrow functions
3 main reasons to use...
  - more concise
  - implicit returns (1 liners easy)
  - doesn't rebind `this` when you use inside another function (e.g. in click handlers)
